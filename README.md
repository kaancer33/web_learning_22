# web_learning_22
my webpage-html-css learning journey

my first index.html was a test file

from now on I will commit all of my changes for learning in HtmlCssLearn file.

Maybe I can try to learn "GIT" in the meantime so maybe there will be going to another test folder about my GIT learning process.
